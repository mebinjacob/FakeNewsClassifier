Trump to go to Florida 'very soon',"(CNN) President Donald Trump lauded the response to Hurricane Irma upon returning to the White House from Camp David on Sunday, adding that he intends to go to Florida ""very soon"" to survey the recovery efforts.

""I think it's been going really well,"" Trump told reporters. ""I mean the bad news is this is some big monster, but I think we're really well-coordinated.""

The President reserved special praise for the Coast Guard and Federal Emergency Management Agency.

""(A) group that really deserves tremendous credit is the United States Coast Guard,"" Trump said, standing next to first lady Melania Trump. ""What they've done, I mean, they're going right into that, and you never know. When you go in there, you don't know if you're going to come out.""

When asked what worries him most about the storm, Trump said ""just the power of this hurricane,"" adding that his team will continue to monitor its path and work on coordination between the federal, state and local governments.

The President added that the response and recovery is ""gonna cost a lot of money. Right now, we're worried about lives, not cost.""

Trump, who is weathering his second hurricane as President in as many weeks, received an update earlier Sunday on the status of Irma as it continues to slam Florida.

Trump was briefed by teleconference on the hurricane's projected path, evacuation plans and preparations for response and recovery, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said.

The President's main concerns are the people in the affected areas and ensuring a ""whole-of-government response,"" said acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke, who participated in the briefing.

""This is going to be a long recovery, hurricane response"" with widespread power outages, Duke told CNN. ""He really wants to make sure that we're taking care of the people.""

About 1.2 million residents were already without power, Duke said, reiterating that outages could affect as many as 5 million people.

""What we're going to need is ... perseverance,"" she said. ""It's going to be a long recovery. The critical infrastructure, the electric companies are going to be huge in this response, and also getting the word out so people know that it may not be (an) immediate search-and-rescue recovery depending on how this storm progresses -- setting expectations.""

The President is focused on keeping in communication with the governors of the affected states so that the federal government can respond to their requests as quickly as possible, Duke said.

The Department of Homeland Security and FEMA will continue to brief Trump at least daily, she said, adding, ""but he is at the touch of a dial away from us.""

The President, who has been meeting with Cabinet members at Camp David this weekend, spoke by phone Sunday morning with the governors of Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee, Sanders said. Florida Gov. Rick Scott mentioned the call to CNN anchor Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union.""

Vice President Mike Pence and other Cabinet members also visited FEMA's headquarters Sunday afternoon.

While there, Pence told reporters Trump has been monitoring the storm around the clock and has directed the full resources of the government to help in the response.

""This continues to be a very dangerous storm,"" Pence said, calling Irma a hurricane of ""epic proportions."" He reiterated that citizens need to heed the warnings of local officials either to shelter in place, if directed to do so, or evacuate.

The briefing the President received at Camp David caused Trump ""great concern"" because, as the hurricane moves up the west coast of the state, the storm surge could result in deaths, Pence told CNN.

""We need to take this seriously,"" he said. ""We need to remain vigilant.""

On Saturday, Trump said he approved emergency declarations in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.

""My administration is monitoring the situation around the clock, and we're in constant communications with all of the governors, with the state and local officials,"" Trump said in a video of the meeting released by the White House.

""We're doing everything possible to help save lives and support those in need,"" he said. ""Again, we've never seen anything like this. Together, we will restore, recover and rebuild. We will do it quickly."""
All the records Irma has already broken -- and other jaw-dropping stats,"(CNN) There hasn't been a storm like Irma to hit the US. Ever.

Consider these stats from CNN's meteorology team:

Irma is the strongest Atlantic basin hurricane ever recorded outside the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea

recorded outside the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea It spent three days as a Category 5 hurricane, the longest Category 5 hurricane since satellite storm-tracking began

since satellite storm-tracking began No storm on record has maintained winds 185 mph or above for as long as Irma (total of 37 hours)

185 mph or above for as long as Irma (total of 37 hours) It prompted the largest evacuation in the history of the Bahamas -- and potentially the largest in the US

Here are some other startling stats that put into perspective the fury and impact of Hurricane Irma:"
"I'm a US military vet, and I feel afraid in my own country","Story highlights Supriya Venkatesan: Having served in the US military in Iraq, I have shown my devotion to this country

Despite this sacrifice and the warmth I found in the military, the current political climate makes me fearful, she writes

Supriya Venkatesan served six years active duty in the US Army, including a 15-month deployment to Iraq. She is a freelance writer based in Seattle, and is working on a book based on her experiences in the military. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.

(CNN) Two days after 9/11, I watched as the news continued to replay images of steel towers crumbling in flames. I looked at the screen from my perch at the hostess stand of a swanky Italian restaurant in downtown Chicago, where I worked.

I had just begun my shift, and my manager pulled me aside. ""We are overstaffed, and we have to lay you off,"" he said. Even as a 16-year-old, I understood that hostesses don't usually get laid off. I was being treated like hundreds of others who were suddenly out of work -- their only fault: sharing the same South Asian features as me. In those days, stories circulated of Indians, and those who looked Muslim, as victims of not only employment bias, but also hate crimes and revenge killings.

Supriya Venkatesan

After holding odd jobs in food service, I joined the US Army as a teenager because I couldn't afford college on my own. But joining the military provided me with much more than tuition assistance. I got a family and a new community that was entirely devoid of racism.

In basic training, a white boy from rural Alabama shared that he had never seen a black person before, and now he not only knew black people, but had made friends with them. As I continued my career living in barracks in South Korea, Iraq, Kuwait and all over the United States, I always thought how remarkable it was that in the hallways you would hear hip-hop, country music and reggaet√≥n -- and occasionally Bollywood from my stereo.

There was a Chinese-American in my unit who grew up without the concept of God, and we talked theology. I cooked chicken tikka masala for my battle buddies, and they devoured it. A Peruvian-American soldier taught me salsa and bachata, and soon I was an expert. Friends who I would have never made outside the military taught me new ideas, shared their food and music, opened up their hearts and had my back when we deployed to Iraq.

This is what South Florida looks like now,"(CNN) South Floridians woke up Sunday to Hurricane Irma as the monster storm made landfall in the Florida Keys, downing trees and hurling street signs and debris and knocking the power out to hundreds of thousands of residents throughout the state.

The National Hurricane Center said Irma is expected to remain powerful as it heads north along the state's Gulf Coast.

This is the scene in south Florida as Irma blasts the state with torrential winds and rain.

The man bringing Sanders-style politics to Moscow,"Moscow (CNN) Self-described political junkie Vitali Shkliarov likes to pepper his conversations with the phrase ""it's a cool story,'' a sign of a man who believes he knows the power of a persuasive narrative.

His own story has taken him from childhood poverty in a crumbling Soviet Union to working on Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders' presidential bids while still learning English.

Today, the 41-year-old Belarussian-born political consultant is in Moscow as part of a small but ambitious push to rewrite the script of Russian politics.

""We're trying to create a new understanding of politics, a sort of political incubator,"" he tells CNN in the movement's headquarters.

Shkliarov says he wants to make politics accessible.

""Sort of like a political Uber -- so you don't have to have a lot of money, experience or expensive consultants to run.""

His experience on successful grassroots campaigns in the US has served him well in Russia, where anti-government parties face an array of obstacles to getting on the ballot.

Last year he started working with leading liberal opposition figures Dmitry Gudkov and Max Katz to change this.

They created a political one-stop shop for people who wanted to stand in Moscow's local elections this coming Sunday, walking would-be candidates through the complicated registration process and working on the city's first voter database.

Shkilarov teaches first-time candidates door-to-door canvassing techniques in August.

Almost 1,000 mostly first-time independent or opposition candidates are now in the running to fill 1,502 municipal posts.

They get support on fundraising, legal issues and leaflet design as well as regular training sessions, including how to canvass voters door-to-door, a relative novelty in Russia.

Shkliarov is passionate when he talks about what he calls Russia's much-needed political facelift

""Russians understand more and more that the way out of this misery is not just blaming the government, not just replacing [President Vladimir] Putin. You have to replace the pattern, so the only way is to participate.""

Opposition slogans, such as a yellow sticker featuring Putin's face and the words ""#fedup,"" is seen inside the movement's headquarters in Moscow in August.

Like the Sanders campaign, the candidates mainly get by on small donations from individuals, working around rules that make it hard to contribute.

Shkliarov uses vocabulary learned on professionally run American campaigns and brings to the movement a combination of Silicon Valley and Washington attitude. ""But we don't just copy and paste the technology or the approach or the strategy. We're trying to adapt,"" he says.

'Sexy and cool' politics

His own path to politics started with Barack Obama's 2008 trip to Germany, where Shkliarov was pursuing a PhD in political science.

He was blown away by how ""sexy and cool'' the presidential hopeful from Chicago made politics seem.

Shkliarov, who had by then cut his teeth on various election campaigns in Germany, including volunteering for Chancellor Angela Merkel, moved to the United States with his American fiancee in 2010 dreaming of working on Obama's re-election run.

The dream came true after he took his wife's advice and offered to work for free.

He progressed from making cold calls to running a team of 40 people within a couple of weeks, he says, in part because his broken English was an ice-breaker.

''My weakness became my biggest strength,"" he says.

It confirmed his belief that ""in America you get a fair shot, no matter where you're from.""

Stacking up successes as he moved locations -- and got on the payroll - he found himself a short while later pushed into giving a pep talk to hundreds of fatigued volunteers in Milwaukee.

Lost for words at first, he started telling them his story.

""I told the truth. I said I was so inspired by your president because in the country I'm from we didn't have democracy. I came so far to help your president, who's not even my president so please don't give me that bulls**t that you can't, that's you're tired or it's raining. Can you do it? And they shouted, 'Yes we can!'""

From Obama to Sanders

Vitali Shkliarov and his son, Nikita, shake hands with Bernie Sanders on the campaign trail.

When Bernie Sanders announced he was running in 2015, Shkliarov was impressed early on.

''After watching the first debate I said to my wife, 'He's amazing.' What he was talking about was hitting the mark.""

When his old boss offered him a job with the Sanders campaign he jumped at the chance, and was immediately hired as director of mobilization for state of Nevada.

He remembers Sanders fondly as ""a bit grumpy"" in person but is enthusiastic about the prospect of working for him again if the 76-year-old decides to run in 2020.

""I've never seen such an amazing team,"" he says.

Eye on Moscow mayoral race

Shkliarov's work in Moscow combines Obama-style optimism with Sanders' social conscience.

He sees the Moscow municipal vote as the perfect Russian test ground for this grassroots approach. As the seat of power, what happens in Moscow matters, even at a local level.

Vitali Shkliarov (L) with opposition politician Dmitry Gudkov.

Getting just over a hundred of their candidates elected will lock up endorsements that Gudkov has to collect to run for mayor. Opposition candidates usually find it impossible to get such backing.

""What we're trying to do, fairly quietly, is change the basic landscape of the system so that one day there's not just one or two opposition leaders, there are 5,000,"" he says.

""The system won't be able to resist then.""

Home from home

Despite his American ties and Belarussian passport, Shkliarov considers himself culturally Russian.

His affection for the United States also shines through, although the current anti-Russia climate disappoints him.

""I'm between two worlds and I see what the Russians don't get in America and vice versa. I know exactly how they are miscommunicating,"" he says.

If his latest Moscow venture doesn't pay off, the self-described idealist says he'll soon be back in DC with his family.

For now he is fully focused on election day.

''We're trying to do politics as a long-term goal, not just winning a campaign or winning one seat. We've tried it so many times and every time we failed because the system is so huge.""

This time, he hopes, will be different."
Tampa is suddenly in Hurricane Irma's path,"Story highlights Hurricane Irma's path has shifted, suddenly threatening cities on Florida's west coast

Tampa's mayor says the city is expecting a storm surge of anywhere from 3 to 8 feet

(CNN) As anxious Florida residents watched weather forecasts this week, it seemed clear Hurricane Irma was on track to strike Miami, Fort Lauderdale and other Atlantic coast cities, prompting a massive evacuation.

But on Saturday, all that changed when Irma's course shifted.

By Sunday morning, the Tampa-St.Petersburg area -- once thought to be relatively safe from harm -- suddenly found itself in the storm's crosshairs.

""We know that we are ground zero for Hurricane Irma,"" Tampa mayor Bob Buckhorn said at a Sunday morning news conference. ""We have for 90 years avoided this day, but I think our day has come.""

The last time Tampa was hit by a major hurricane was in 1921

Cuba blasted as Hurricane Irma tears through Caribbean,"Caibari√©n, Cuba (CNN) Recovery efforts are underway in Cuba one day after Hurricane Irma smashed into the country's north en route towards the Florida Keys .

Irma made landfall in Cuba overnight on Friday as a Category 5 storm, blasting into seaside towns and causing flooding in low-lying areas of the capital Havana. Hurricane-force winds of 125 mph (over 200 kp/h) whipped roofs clean off buildings, ripped trees from the ground and forced evacuations along the coast.

As Irma made its way through the Florida Keys and towards the US mainland on Sunday afternoon, the last remaining hurricane warning in Cuba was discontinued for the provinces of Matanzas and La Habana.

But rainfall is expected to continue through Wednesday, producing an additional one to three inches of rain in western Cuba and up to five inches in isolated areas, putting authorities on alert for flash floods and mudslides amid recovery and clean-up efforts.

Meanwhile, other islands in the Caribbean still reeling from Irma are bracing for the potential impact of another storm, Hurricane Jose.

Irma's blinding rain and powerful winds began pummeling Caibari√©n, a small coastal city about 320 kilometres east of Havana, late Friday. The outer bands of the massive storm knocked out power in a town that normally would be busy with tourists.

By dawn Saturday, waves were rolling down the town's main street. Within hours, the whole town was flooded with several feet of water.

Most people in the coastal area live in one-story homes, putting them at great risk as floodwaters rose to roof level in some places. Residents were overwhelmed by the damage and said recovery will take time. Many had left town before the storm hit and all foreigners were urged to evacuate. Those who remained told CNN they were prepared, though they knew this was a storm like few had ever experienced.

Meanwhile, as dusk fell Saturday in Havana, the churning waters moved inland from the city's popular seafront boulevard. Flooding continued Sunday afternoon along the malec√≥n, spreading into adjacent streets with waist-level water in some areas. At the US Embassy in Havana, part of a fence that guards the compound was knocked over. US Marines and Cuban police surrounded the area.

Water battered the city's pier and flooding some low-lying areas of Havana on Saturday.

So far there have been no reports of deaths in Cuba. Elsewhere in the Caribbean, 24 deaths have been attributed to Irma. Of the 24 deaths, nine were in various French territories, one in Barbuda, one in Anguilla, two in St. Maarten, four in the British Virgin Islands, four in the US Virgin Islands, and three in Puerto Rico.

The Cuban government prepared by staging emergency supplies and building equipment ahead of the arrival of Irma. Authorities cut power to parts of the city and evacuated around 10,000 people from central Havana amid concerns of storm surge flooding, according to Reuters

Elsewhere in the country, Irma struck the archipelago north of Cuba's Camaguey and Ciego de Avila provinces with gusts so strong they destroyed an instrument used to measure wind, Cuba's meteorological agency reported.

Hurricane-strength winds later were recorded in the northern half of Camaguey province, the agency said. Irma was the first Category 5 hurricane to hit Camaguey in 85 years, according to the province's state media radio station.

As Irma advanced over neighboring Ciego de Avila province, waves of between 16- and 23-foott waves (5 to 7 meters) were recorded.

In the resort town of Varadero in the Matanzas province, 14,500 foreign tourists rode out the storm, according to state-run news organization Granma.

Irma left a string of small Caribbean islands devastated, many of which are still assessing damage as they prepare for Hurricane Jose.

The tiny island of Barbuda was perhaps worst hit . Prime Minister Gaston Browne described the result as ""total devastation.""

Antigua, Barbuda's sister island and home to about 80,000 people, was spared the brunt of the storm. Many residents there have been evacuated ahead of Jose.

Evacuations continue on the island ahead of Hurricane Jose. Between Friday and Sunday afternoon, the United States evacuated approximately 1,200 Americans from St. Maarten, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.

A man and a boy take a look at the damage Irma brought on September 7, in Marigot, near the Bay of Nettle, on the island of St. Martin.

Irma caused roughly 1.2 billion euros ($1.44 billion) of insured damage in the French portion of St. Martin and in St. Barts, according to French state-owned insurer CCR. The estimate includes damages to homes, vehicles and businesses -- including operating losses -- which are covered by the natural disaster compensation scheme, CCR said Saturday.

Looting broke out on the island, French and Dutch authorities said Friday, and security forces were deployed to deal with the problem. The island is home to about 72,000 people.

Just to the north, Anguilla, a 90-square kilometer island that is among several British overseas territories in the Caribbean, ""received the hurricane's full blast,"" according to UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister Alan Duncan.

The US and British Virgin Islands were also pummeled by Irma. Pictures from St. Thomas, the most populated of the US Virgin Islands and a popular tourist destination, showed extensive damage.

Wreckage in Irma's wake is seen Wednesday on St. Thomas, a tourist destination in the US Virgin Islands.

A state of emergency remains in place for British Virgin Islands. ""All of us have been affected by Irma, and some more than others,"" Gus Jaspert, governor of the British Virgin Islands, said Thursday.

""Apart from the structural damage, there have sadly been reports of casualties and fatalities,"" he added. ""I am truly heartbroken by this news.""

First responders check an empty car caught in floodwaters Wednesday in Fajardo, Puerto Rico.

Puerto Rico, an unincorporated US territory, managed to avoid a direct hit from Irma but suffered strong winds and torrential rains. Hundreds of thousands of people remained without power on Friday.

Strong winds and heavy rain also lashed the Dominican Republic, Haiti and the low-lying Turks and Caicos Islands Thursday into Friday. The Turks and Caicos' capital island of Grand Turk suffered ""quite a bit of damage,"" including to part of a hospital's roof, Gov. John Freeman told CNN on Friday."
Shorelines drained in eerie effect of Hurricane Irma,"(CNN) Hurricane Irma's extraordinary strength has caused a seemingly unusual meteorological phenomena: the eerie pushing of water away from shorelines in the Bahamas and the Gulf Coast of Florida.

Jason Beisel, a spokesman for the Florida city of Clearwater, described the scene in a tweet on Sunday: ""Creepy site - water in Tampa Bay is already being sucked out. This is view from downtown St. Pete waterfront.""

Creepy site - water in Tampa Bay is already being sucked out. This is view from downtown St. Pete waterfront. #HurricaneIrma pic.twitter.com/4hqRDSrDsh

In Charlotte Harbor, the second largest bay in Florida, Dylan Branscome posted a video on Facebook showing dry, sandy landscape as if the bay had evaporated.

In places like Tampa and Port Charlotte, as the storm approaches from the south, strong winds blowing from the northeast have pushed water out of shallow parts of bays and harbors, according to CNN meteorologist Judson Jones.

""As soon as the wind shifts direction, the water will come back quickly and continue to move inland,"" Jones said.

""The height of the storm surge will depend on the exact track of the storm. If the eye of the storm tracks to the west of the bays, the storm surge will be worse.""

'Gee whiz' element

Shuyi Chen, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle, said the weather phenomena is common during extreme storm conditions like Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

""After the storm center passes Tampa, the wind will change from offshore to onshore and push water and large ocean surface waves onshore,"" he said, referring to the storm surge.

""In addition to onshore wind, Irma's northward motion will bring extreme large surface waves when it gets closer to Tampa.""

storm surge is a gradual rise in the water level caused by a major storm's wind as it gets closer to shore.

Chen said the strength, size and forward motion of the hurricane affect ocean surface waves, water level and temperature -- effectively changing the shape of the ocean.

Scott Hagen, director of the Center for Coastal Resiliency at Louisiana State University, said there is a ""gee whiz"" element to the phenomena.

""It's such a rarity along the west coast of Florida,"" he said. ""I had expected it but to see it must really be dramatic if you actually get to go out there and take a look at it.""

Therein lies the danger.

""Don't get caught up in that,"" Hagen said.

""There's a sense of awe. Just like when we're frightened. When we see something that we haven't seen before and we're so amazed by it, we take chances that we really shouldn't be taking.""

He added, ""It is within the realm of possibility that (the water) comes back more dramatically than if it were just a surge blowing up on land without the water being removed from the shore areas by the winds ahead of the eye of the storm.""

The receding shoreline can give people a false sense of security, CNN meteorologist Gene Norman said.

""It is particularly dangerous because it may not be apparent that the winds have switched to an onshore direction,"" he said. ""Similar to those who come out during the passing of the eye. Winds will and do pick up again once the eye passes.""

"Irma, now a Category 2 hurricane, hits Naples","(CNN) Editor's note: This is a developing story that is being constantly updated as the storm progresses. Also, follow our live updates here or watch unlimited CNN .

[Breaking news alert, posted at 5:12 p.m. ET Sunday]

Hurricane Irma is now a Category 2 storm, threatening to bring dangerous storm surges along Florida's west coast, the National Hurricane Center said Sunday evening. At 5 p.m. ET, the storm was about 5 miles north of Naples, Florida, packing maximum sustained winds of 110 mph.

[Previous story, posted at 4:33 p.m. ET Sunday]

Hurricane Irma slammed into southwest Florida on Sunday, packing 120 mph winds as it made its second landfall in the state.

The dangerous Category 3 storm made landfall at 3:35 p.m. ET in Marco Island, Florida.

That city and nearby Naples, Florida, will endure some of the strongest winds in the next few hours, the National Hurricane Center said.

Irma is uprooting trees and turning streets into rivers. And there's plenty more to come.

Palm trees lie strewn across a road Sunday in Miami Beach, Florida.

Marco Island Police Chief Al Schettino said the worst part of the storm was hitting his city. Without power, emergency officials are using a backup radio system to communicate, he said.

""We're all hanging in there,"" he said, ""ready to get out there to help others as soon as it's safe to do so.""

Areas that aren't facing a direct hit from Irma are already seeing flooding and downed power lines.

""We're getting slammed right now,"" Josh Levy, the mayor of Hollywood, Florida, said on Sunday afternoon.

Expected to be even more dangerous than the powerful winds are the storm surges that threaten Florida's coastal cities.

""The threat of catastrophic storm surge flooding is highest along the southwest coast of Florida, where 10 to 15 feet of inundation above ground level is expected,"" the hurricane center said. ""This is a life-threatening situation.""

Still, not everyone heeded orders to evacuate coastal Florida.

Wayne Ploghoft hunkered down Sunday on the third floor of a building on Marco Island -- where life-threatening storm surges are imminent.

Ploghoft said he wasn't able to evacuate because his flight plans didn't work out. Now Ploghoft and three others are holed up with stockpiles of water, canned food and battery power.

""We're all going to be OK,"" Ploghoft said.

Gov. Rick Scott said Irma's wrath is unprecedented.

""We have never had anything like this before,"" he said Sunday.

Waves crash over a seawall as Irma slams Miami.

In Florida and southern Georgia, more than 8 million people face hurricane-force winds topping 74 mph, said Ryan Maue of WeatherBell Analytics.

And almost the entire state of Florida is under a hurricane warning, affecting at least 36 million people.

Miami succumbs to Irma's wrath

Gusts topping 90 mph whipped Miami on Sunday, knocking out power to more than 750,000 customers in the Miami-Dade area.

Flying objects such as coconuts turned into dangerous projectiles. And at least one construction crane snapped, swinging vigorously over downtown Miami.

Matthew Spuler captured video of waves crashing over a seawall toward his downtown high-rise building.

""There is no seawall whatsoever,"" Spuler said. ""It's amazing. It's under water.""

The latest developments:

-- A second construction crane has partially collapsed in Miami, dangling above a street in the Edgewater neighborhood, City of Miami Commissioner Francis Suarez told CNN on Sunday.

-- The center of Hurricane Irma is nearing Naples, Florida, the National Hurricane Center said. Airports in the area reported powerful winds, including a sustained wind of 55 mph (88 kph) and a gust of 82 mph (132 kph) at Naples Municipal Airport, and a sustained wind of 63 mph (102 kph) and a gust of 84 mph (135 kph) at Opa-Locka Executive Airport.

-- A personal weather station at the Marco Island Police Department reported a wind gust of 130 mph, the National Weather Service said.

-- Miami-Dade County announced a curfew between 7 p.m. Sunday and 7 a.m. Monday.

-- Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal has expanded a state of emergency to include all 159 Georgia counties, Deal's office said. The decision was made in advance of heavy rains, strong winds and potential flooding from Hurricane Irma. The state government will be closed Monday and Tuesday except for essential personnel.

-- The forecast track for Irma has shifted 15 miles east, the National Hurricane Center said. But it's still not clear exactly when or where on the Florida mainland Irma will make landfall -- meaning half the hurricane's eye is over land.

""With the eye tracking this close to land, everyone needs to be prepared for the worst possible conditions,"" CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.

-- More than 1.69 million electric customers across 31 counties are without power, Florida Power and Light said Sunday morning.

-- Miami-Dade officers can no longer respond to calls for service, the Miami-Dade Police Department tweeted Sunday. Police are urging residents to stay indoors and not venture outside.

-- A 6 p.m. curfew has been put in place for Tampa. Manatee County officials announced a curfew from 3 p.m. ET Sunday until 3 p.m. ET Monday.

-- A storm surge warning wraps around the state, from Brevard County to Tampa Bay.

'You can't survive these storm surges'

The governor warned that storm surges could be deadly.

""You can't survive these storm surges,"" he said.

Those who did not evacuate ahead of the storm are in danger, Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long said Saturday.

""You're on your own until we can actually get in there and it's safe,"" he told CNN.

But Key West business owner Jason Jonas said he stayed behind because he's in a home that is ""built like a bunker.""

""It's pretty much the only reason I considered staying here because I knew that I had a pretty good chance of making it through this thing,"" he said.

""We're 30 plus feet above sea level and in a place that's built to withstand 225 mph winds -- I mean that's a better chance than being exposed out on the highway in traffic trying to make it to Georgia.""

Mass evacuations jammed highways heading north and created a severe gas shortage in some parts of the state.

Irma hit Cuba's Ciego de Avila province late Friday as a Category 5 hurricane before it weakened and headed to the United States.

This is the the first year on record that the continental United States has had two Category 4 hurricane landfalls in the same year.

Last month, Hurricane Harvey devastated much of coastal Texas and killed more than 70 people

Other cities will get pummeled

Several Florida cities are in or near the forecast path of the storm's eye.

The storm will be devastating for central Florida, Tampa, Fort Myers and Key West, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said.

In Fort Myers, where storm surge warnings are in effect, Evanson Ngai stayed up all night Saturday, tracking the hurricane.

""I've tried to get some sleep but I can't. Just the nervousness, trying to keep an eye on it to see if its track will change,"" he said.

Ngai said he planned to crouch in the bathtub when the storm makes landfall.

""Right now, it's a little bit of gusty winds and some rain,"" he said early Sunday. ""We've moved everything away from windows. We're hoping for the best -- we've bought nonperishable foods and water, and we have a flashlight.""

Florida Power and Light estimated 3.4 million of its customers could be without power at some point during Irma, the company's largest number of outages ever.

""We think this could be the most challenging restoration in the history of the US,"" company spokesman Chris McGrath said.

Other states may be affected

As Irma moves inland, more than 45 million people will face tropical storm conditions -- meaning winds will top 39 mph, Maue said. Affected states include Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, South Carolina and North Carolina.

South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster issued a mandatory evacuation for some barrier islands.

The National Weather Service in Atlanta issued a tropical storm watch for the area Monday and Tuesday. Schools in the state planned to close Monday.
